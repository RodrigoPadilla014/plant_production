# 🏭 Plant Production Analysis

This project explores production data from a manufacturing plant to identify trends and insights using Python and pandas. The dataset includes production records by product and date.

## 📊 Objectives

- Clean and organize raw production data
- Analyze total and monthly production per product
- Detect production outliers
- Identify the most produced product and most productive month
- Determine which product has the most production variability month-to-month
- Visualize production trends over time
- Export useful summaries

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib

## 📁 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `plant_production.csv` | Raw production dataset |
| `monthly_summary.csv` | Total units produced per product per month |
| `plant_production.ipynb` | Analysis code |

## 📈 Key Questions Answered

1. **Which product had the highest total production?**  
2. **Which month had the highest overall production?**  
3. **Which product showed the most variability across months?**

## 📤 Outputs
